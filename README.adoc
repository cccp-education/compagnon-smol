= compagnon-smol

This project is based on the [Smol Agents](https://github.com/hwchase17/smol-agents) course/examples by Harrison
Chase (Hugging Face). It implements a simplified agent framework for experimenting with language models and aut
onomous behavior.

== Description

This project is a modified version of the Smol Agents course. It adapts the framework to interact with internal Block APIs and services, focusing on practical applications within the Block ecosystem.

== Key Files

*   `academy.py`: This file defines the core agent logic and the environment in which the agent operates. It includes the task definition, planning, and execution steps.
*   `calculator_tool.py`: This file implements a tool that allows the agent to perform calculations using a Python interpreter.
*   `config.py`: This file contains configuration settings for the agent, such as API keys, model parameters, and other environment-specific variables.
*   `utils.py`: This file provides utility functions and helper classes used throughout the project, such as text processing, data handling, and API interaction.
*   `weather_tool.py`: This file implements a tool that allows the agent to retrieve weather information for a given location using a weather API.

== Dependencies

This project's dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

== Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/compagnon-smol.git
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

== Usage

To run the agent, execute the `main.py` script with the desired task as a command-line argument.  Ensure you have set the necessary API keys in `config.py`.

For example:

```bash
python main.py --task "Find the current price of Square stock"
```

== Testing

The project uses the `pytest` framework. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory. To run the tests, use the command `pytest` from the project root directory.
